# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustive* which means that it includes everything that you could do on the project included in the
curriculum in this course. Therefore, we do not expect at all that you have checked all boxes at the end of the project.
The parenthesis at the end indicates what module the bullet point is related to. Please be honest in your answers, we
will check the repositories and the code to verify your answers.

### Question 3
> **A requirement to the project is that you include a third-party package not covered in the course. What framework**
> **did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

We used the Pytorch Image Models (timm) deep-learning library for our project as it aligned with our objectives and requirements,
as it has a high variety of available pre-trained models that we could choose from. From this we used the pretrained model
"mobilenetv3_small_050.lamb_in1k"  which is a image classification model trained on Image-Net1k. We compared this model to a
simple baseline convolutional neural network that we built using pytorch. The advantage of using the timm library is the easy
integration of the pretrained models and the ease of changing to a different model from the available library. Using the model,
the X-Ray images from our dataset were analysed for signs of pneumonia infections and classified in the positive or negative
class.

## Coding environment

In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment. This includes how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

We used conda (or miniconda) to manage our dependencies for python. A requirements.txt file can be found in the repository. These two commands are enough to get the libraries needed for the python environment : conda create --name mlops python=3.11 (firstly create an environment, we used python 3.11) pip install -r requirements.txt (and then install all the libraries listed in the requirements.txt). The requirements.txt has the libraries needed to create the data, train the model and evaluate it. There are some more files with requirements lists for some more stuff we did like the requirements_dev for stuff like linting with ruff and the requirements_test for stuff related to testing like pytest. Also Dvc was used for data management so dvc pull can be used to get the data. the processed data are also saved in the dvc so running the data.py is

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
>
> Answer:

To create an efficient structure for our ML project, we utilized the cookiecutter library, specifically the template provided by this course. Most parts of the template remained unchanged, however, we added some new folders to enhance the project's functionality. First, we included a logs folder, where all the log files from the training and evaluation processes are saved. Additionally, we introduced an experiments folder to store experiment-related files, such as coverage.txt, which provides details about the number of lines tested by our unit tests. Lastly, a wandb file was added to the structure, containing information about the runs logged on the Weights and Biases (wandb) framework.

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,**
> **explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These*
> *concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...*
>
> Answer:

We followed pep8 guidelines for code quality which were also enforced with ruff. Also for linting a pre-commit was used which has stuff like removing whitespaces and such. Also we tried to follow coding practices as snake_case for functions and other "standard rules" which are used typically in python code so that it would be more easily readable to people familiar with python code. Practices like these are essential for code readability, understanding and for code maintenance to be easier. For projects like this one which I would say is supposed to mimic a research project it creates an easier way for people to meddle and do changes in the code. For bigger projects and companies maintenance and the ability to do quick code changes is essential, these practices help achieve that.

## Version control

In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

>
> Answer:

We did include branches in some cases. For example we used branches when working on specific features that we were unsure about including at the time of workin on it, so we could avoid dealing with any merging issues, during our work on the feature. We did not include pull requests when merging our work to the main branch since a lot of the work was done while working in a group setting, which made it possible to review and talk about our changes in person. Additionally, we worked with pull requests since we implemented a dependabot that issued pull requests for use-cases like python library versioning.

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**

>
> Example:
> *We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: Python  my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25*
>
> Answer:

We used typer to manage the configuration of our hyperparameters for experiments. We only found out afterwards that integrating both Hydra and Typer does not make as much sense and since the work for Typer was already done and some of our code was not properly setup for Hydra (to work properly with pointers) we decided to stick with the already completed Typer workflow (after asking the TAs in Slack).

Example: python evaluate.py --model-name Pretrained --batch-size 64 --device-type cpu --pretrained True

>
> Example:
> *We managed to train our model in the cloud using the Engine. We did this by ... . The reason we choose the Engine*
> *was because ...*
>
> Answer:

After pushing our Docker container to the Artifact Registry, we successfully trained our model using Vertex AI. To achieve this, we created a vertexai_config.yaml file, which is included in the configs folder. This file specifies the machine type required for training—n1-highmem-2 (CPU)—as we observed during earlier exercises that our model could be trained locally on a CPU. Hence, the job could be accomplished with fewer resources. In addition, we specified the number of replicas (set to 1) and provided the path to the Docker image stored in the cloud. To submit the job to Vertex AI, we used the following command:

gcloud ai custom-jobs create --region=europe-west1 --display-name=training --config=vertexai_config.yaml

We monitored the training process by streaming logs, which allowed us to track the performance and progress of the job. One observation was that the training process on Vertex AI was somewhat slow, as the initial setup of the service during the first run was time-consuming. The reason we chose Vertex AI instead of a VM is that we found this process to be more straightforward.

## Deployment

>
> Answer:
We managed to deploy model as an application using FastAPI. Initially, we served the model locally to evaluate its functionality. We then used Docker to containerize the program defining dependencies and parameters in a Dockerfile. The container opens a port for GoogleCloud Run. The image contains both the trained model and the API code, with uvicorn serving the FastAPI app. The cloud deployment was done using GoogleCloud run.

>
> Example:
> *We did not manage to implement monitoring. We would like to have monitoring implemented such that over time we could*

>
> Answer:

We worked on implementing some monitoring on the deployed API using google cloud alerts and SLOs similair to what we did in the exercises. With this service we monitor the latency of the requests to the api and check the ratio of requests that go above our latency threshhold. This is to make sure that the responses of the API are quick so the users will quickly get their model predictinos. Furthermore we monitor the amount of requests to the API since we did not work out load testing, so if the amounts of requests increases above our thresshold we will have to check if everything is still working fine. 

## Overall discussion of project

> In the following section we would like you to think about the general structure of your project.

### Question 27

> Example:
> *Group member 1 used ..., Group member 2 used ..., in total ... credits was spend during development. The service*
> *costing the most was ... due to ... . Working in the cloud was ...*
>
> Answer:

We only used about $1 for our general project on the API since our used services were not that expensive. Obviously this will would still be subject to change over time. So our developement as a group was rather inexpensive and we still have some credits left for experimentation. Of course we somehow still learned the hard lesson , from one group member who opened a container with a GPU and forgot to shut it down, watching the credits pour away, so the prophecy from the lecture became true. 

### Question 28

> **Did you implement anything extra in your project that is not covered by other questions? Maybe you implemented**

>
> Example:
> *We implemented a frontend for our API. We did this because we wanted to show the user ... . The frontend was*
> *implemented using ...*
>
> Answer:

We created a frontend for our API, since we thought it would be a nice and easy way to make the API accessible. Setting up the frontend was done using Streamlit and was a very nice process, since it is very intuative to use and easy to understand. The frontend allows the user to upload an X-Ray chest image, like from the dataset, and quickly get a "diagnosis" by the pretrained model stating wether pneunomia was detected or not. We also used streamlit community cloud to make the frontend accessible using the following [https://mlops-group-60-iapprrdd7xn3hmfg8lzazfv.streamlit.app](https://mlops-group-60-iapprrdd7xn3hmfg8lzazfv.streamlit.app).

Furthermore we created Documentation using MkDocs to gain some experience using it and have some basic documentation for our codebase. The documentation can be accessed using this [https://siderishub.github.io/Mlops-group-60/](https://siderishub.github.io/Mlops-group-60/).

> Example:

>
> Answer:

The biggest challenge in our project was organizing all the various MLOps tools and services into a full working pipeline. Initially, we struggled with setting up everything since each team member had differing amounts of programming and software experience. Also the knowledge on machine and deep learning was uneven so we had to work on this in the beginning to make sure everyone knows where we want this project to go.

Another time-consuming aspect was learning how to properly use and integrate Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services—particularly Vertex AI and Cloud Run. Since most of us had limited experience with these services, we spent some time reviewing official GCP documentation, watching tutorials and experimenting with the services. Other times we struggled a bit since we tried to implement features too late, like working on hydra when we had already used typer for the hyperparameters. Similair we had some challenges when trying to implement lightning after we already had all our training, model and evluation files working so we decided not to refracture everything.

We also ran into challenges with continuous integration (CI) and test coverage. Our codebase grew quickly, and ensuring that the important parts of new functionality was covered by tests took some work, but with the help of the exercise practice it worked well. 

Overall, our biggest takeaway was the importance of proper planning and thinking ahead. By working on each part of the project in smaller steps and working together as a team we were able to integrate the pieces into a full MLOps pipeline successfully.

> Answer:


Student s241878 was in charge of working partially on the basemodel, the api frontend, the documentation, writing parts the report
working partially on the api and helping with some collaboration.

We used ChatGPT to help us debug our code in cases where we were unfamiliar with error codes or using new packages like Streamlit
where just a small comment was missing. We partially used GitHub Copilot to write the code but it often was not to useful since
it seemed to be unaware of the project structure.
